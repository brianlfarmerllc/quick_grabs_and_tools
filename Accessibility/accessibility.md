# Accessability 

1. Semantics - Use HTML5 elements to structure page like header, nav, main, article, aside, and footer. Reserve use of div and span for layout purposes. Use one H1 per page and heading levels should be used in logical order for heading structure
2. Contrast - Text should be clear and readable against background. Make use of browser developer tools to check contrast ratio scores of every page.
3. Keyboard -  Able to navigate site without the use of a mouse. Use tools in css like :focus in order to style elements for animation or borders to allow users to clearly see what they are trying to access. Tabbing should allow user to navigate accross links and all inputs as well as using the arrows and page up/down keys to navigate the site
4. Text - English articals and text should be read left to right. Use center align text only for short amounts of text. Use a minimum of 16px text for readibility. Text size should be declared in em or rem values to allow user to adjust text in browser as needed
5. Labels and Alts - use labels for input fields in forms. Using a for="" on the label that matches the id="" of the input allows users to access the the field by clicking anywhere on the label or field. Add alt="" and titles to img a links that describe what the link does. Images that only surve the purpose of design do not need alt descriptions but still require the attr. 

Developer tools for accessability can be found in firefox dev tools.
