## DOM - Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a
document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.
DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them, you can change the document’s structure, style, or content.
Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them; once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

The document object is a built-in object that has many properties and methods that we can use to access and modify websites.
In order to understand how to work with the DOM, you must understand how objects work in JavaScript.
